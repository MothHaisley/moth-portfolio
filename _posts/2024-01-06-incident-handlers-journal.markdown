description: This project involved responding to a ransomware attack at a small U.S.-based healthcare clinic. The attackers gained access through phishing emails containing a malicious attachment, leading to the encryption of critical medical files. I tracked the incident, identifying the phishing attack as the initial access point, and documented the steps taken to mitigate the threat, including seeking external assistance. The response highlighted key cybersecurity concepts such as phishing, malware, and ransomware, and underscored the importance of quick containment and communication in a healthcare environment.
